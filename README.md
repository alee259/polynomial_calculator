# Polynomial Calculator
This program is designed to perform mathematical operations on polynomials. 
Input is formatted as either of the following:
3^7 2^5 -3^3 10^0 or 3x^7 4x^5 -14x^3
Fractional coefficients can be input as : 3/2, or 4/5, etc...

# Functions
This calculator can add and subtract polynomials. In addition, the calcualtor can multiply two polynomials together, ie (2x^2 + 2x + 1)(3x^2+3)
It can also evaluate a polynomial at a user given value. Finally, the program can perform basic calculus functions such as derivation and integration (only power rule and indefinite integrals)
